# Multiplayer-Number-Guessing-Game
it is a multiplayer number guessing game in which minimum 1 player and maximum 2 players can play it was my first c project please play it and ive me reviews how is it 

in this game first you have to choose how many players are going to play
if there is only 1 player you sould press 1 and enter 
then system will assign a random number in the game from 0-100
an will ask you to guess it then you have to guess it 
let suppose system as assigned the number 64
and you have entered the number 50 then system will tell you your number is smaller ten the assined number which implies that you have to uess a greater number ten 50
now you entered 84 system will tell you your number is greater 
this is how the game works an you will be able to guess the number

thankyou!!
